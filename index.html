        <p class="first">When you gain perfect knowledge in this world..</p> 
        <p>You unlock the power to understand the depths of life, solve the toughest challenges, and inspire those around you. Knowledge is not just about facts and figures—it’s about wisdom, perspective, and the ability to make a meaningful impact. With true knowledge, you see the world not as it is but as it could be, empowering you to create change, grow continuously, and leave a legacy that uplifts others. It’s a journey, not a destination, and the more you learn, the more you realize how infinite the possibilities are.</p>
